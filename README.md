## Overview

The external facts module is a simple wrapper around Facter 1.7+ support
for external facts.

## Module Description

The external facts module installs supporting directory structures and creates
external facts on demand. These are defined on your hosts by puppet DSL and on
subsequent runs are sent to the master for use in manifest compilation. If the
fact definition is removed the fact is automatically purged and will become
absent in subsequent puppet runs.

## Usage

#### Enabling Support

Hosts must declare the directory management portion of the module if they want
non-existant facts to be purged and no facts are being pushed.

    include ::external_facts

NOTE: As long as there is at least one fact being created auto-purging of other
non-manged facts will occur even if the base class is not included

#### Creating facts

This can either be with an implicit value of true

    external_facts::fact { 'a_fact': }

or may be declared with an explicit value for use elsewhere

    external_facts::fact { 'servicegroups':
      value => 'http,https',
    }

## Limitations

This module should work on all GNU Linux systems, but has only been tested on
Ubuntu and RedHat.
